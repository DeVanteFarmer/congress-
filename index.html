            <h2>Sen. Joe Manchin</h2>
            <p>West Virginia: known for its predominantly conservative political landscape. Historically a Democratic stronghold due to its coal mining roots, the state has shifted significantly toward the Republican Party in recent decades. This transition is largely attributed to economic challenges, cultural values, and responses to federal environmental regulations impacting the coal industry. West Virginia's political representation is predominantly Republican in both state and federal legislatures. The state's voters have consistently supported Republican presidential candidates since the early 2000s, reflecting a broader realignment in the Appalachian region.</p>
